# blog - Liam O'Reilly

Welcome to my blog. This is going to be used as a space where I share my thoughts, ideas, and experiences.

The intention of this blog is two-fold. First, I would like to improve my writing skills. Over the past few years I have been studying and working exclusively in tech, and have done very little formal writing. While I do not necessarily intent on writing essays here, I do feel like the ability to convey my thoughts in succinct and expressive ways is of great importance. This medium will allow me to practice putting my thoughts into words, so if you read this please view it as such.

My second reason is simple. I wish to chronicle what is going on in my life, explore my interests, and appreciate what I am experiencing. In this way, my blog may be more of a journal, or even a diary. In recent years, I fear that most of my "writing" has been in text messages and tweets. Writing exclusively in this way feels like interacting with others purely through smalltalk. This is an attempt to have conversations.

Again, I am viewing this blog as an exercise in self-improvement and creative expression. Maybe I will write only a few entries, maybe this will be a lasting endeavor. In any case if you are reading this, thanks for visiting and please do reach out if you would like to discuss anything at all.
