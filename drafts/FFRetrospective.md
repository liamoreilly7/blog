# 2025 Fantasy Football Retrospective
January 15, 2025

This past fall was the most fun I have had following a professional sports league in recent memory. For the first time in my life, I committed to following America's most beloved league, the NFL. The reasons for this warrant an entry of its own, but in brief I have become somewhat apathetic towards the state of European soccer, and was back on the East Coast surrounded by the leaguemates of my fantasy football league. 

Fantasy Football is an interesting thing, and a truly great idea. It combines some of the best aspects of sports fandom, while removing those that may cause the feeling of disengagement that can happen as a season wears on. From draft day until my eventual triumph in the championship, I had a great time crafting my lineup, negotiating with my leaguemates, and watching RedZone on Sundays. What I came to truly appreciate is how having a fantasy team allows fans to decouple themselves somewhat from the state of their favorite franchise. As a long-time Everton fan, I know all too well what losing feels like. It seems like each year our hopes of success are all but gone after only 25% of the games have been played. With Fantasy Football, there is always something to play for. Avoiding a punishment, pushing for the playoffs, or striving for a championship; these are all reasons to stay engaged. 

So, before the memory of this past NFL regular season fades, I want to go over some trends I noticed, and make some predictions for next year's season. I'm sure this will only make me look foolish in retrospect, but it's my blog so here we go.
