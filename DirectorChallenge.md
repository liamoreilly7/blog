# Rushmore: Watching 4 Films from Celebrated Directors

Watching Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer (2023) was one of the more memorable experiences I have had in recent years. I was in Los Angeles over the summer, and read an article about the film releasing in the 70mm Imax format. Of course, I had no idea what this meant, but when I discovered that only thirty-odd theaters in the world offered the format, I was intruiged. Fast forward two weeks and I am sat inside the massive Ontario Regal Edwards Palace Imax theater. Three hours later, I came back to reality and began processing what had just transpired. I have always loved watching movies, but since that experience in July 2023, I began paying more attention. There were so many movies to watch! And so accessible. In the spirit of film discovery, I hope to watch 4 new films from some celebrated directors in world cinema (I have alread seen a few films of a handful of these directors). 

This page will monitor my progress, and contain any thoughts or reviews. I hope to grow as a watcher of film; perhaps even learn about culture and history through international cinema. Tentatively, I am going to alternate between English and Foreign-language directors, and hope to keep it fresh thematically. 

Prior to this challenge, I had watched 3 of Akira Kurosawa's films: **Rashomon** (1950), **Seven Samurai** (1954), and **High and Low** (1963), all in the first week of July 2024. The brilliant storytelling of **Rashomon**, including its jumps between story and storyteller provided a compelling entry into his work. Out of the three, this film would benefit the most from a rewatch. Watching a new 4k release of **Seven Samurai** that Friday night in the Film Forum was certainly a night to remember, and I was lucky enough to have taken my parents out to dinner in the West Village beforehand. Right off the bat, I was struck by the physicality of the performances in these first two films. The way the actors bounced between crouching and standing, the animated nature of their interactions, and the force with which dialogue and fights were delivered were all immediately noticable. After one viewing, both films' stellar reputations are well-deserved, and are undoubtably worthy of analysis upon rewatch. **High and Low**, too is a wonderful watch. The detective/crime procedural sub-genre is one of my favorites. Over the past year alone, I have loved **Memories of Murder, Se7en, Silence of the Lambs, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo**, to name a few. **High and Low** is among the best of this group, and is easily one of the most captivating, thrilling films I have ever seen.

All to say Kurosawa's work is a fitting place to start.
