# Rushmore: Watching 4 Films from Celebrated Directors

Watching Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer (2023) was one of the more memorable experiences I have had in recent years. I was in Los Angeles over the summer, and read an article about the film releasing in the 70mm Imax format. Of course, I had no idea what this meant, but when I discovered that only thirty-odd theaters in the world offered the format, I was intruiged. Fast forward two weeks and I am sat inside the massive Ontario Regal Edwards Palace Imax theater. Three hours later, I came back to reality and began processing what had just transpired. I have always loved watching movies, but since that experience in July 2023, I began paying more attention. There were so many movies to watch! And so accessible. In the spirit of film discovery, I hope to watch 4 new films from some celebrated directors in world cinema (I have alread seen a few films of a handful of these directors). 

This page will monitor my progress, and contain any thoughts or reviews. I hope to grow as a watcher of film; perhaps even learn about culture and history through international cinema. Tentatively, I am going to alternate between English and Foreign-language directors, and hope to keep it fresh thematically.
